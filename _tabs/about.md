# Howdy! 

I'm Aros Ontiveros (s8lt), a Senior Cybersecurity Student at the University of Texas at San Antonio on track to graduate in Spring 2025 with my BAA in Cybersecurity. I'm currently a Cybersecurity Intern with the Data Security Team at AssetWorks. I am learning in depth on cybersecurity standards and getting hands-on experience involving internal auditing. 


I'm the current Vice President of a student-led organization called CyberJedis at UTSA. I am responsible for overviewing a team of officers to coordinate and execute all event logistics. I'm very passionate about gaining skills in the Cybersecurity field and achieving my passion of becoming a Security Engineer.


I recently completed a internship in the Summer of 2024 as a Cybersecurity Intern with the Texas Workforce Commission office in Austin, Tx. I gained skills in vulnerability assessments, risk assessments, risk documentaion and GRC frameworks. 


I am looking forward to improving my skills as I continue to utilize resources online to further my skills including HTB, CyberDefenders and Let's Defend. Using this website, I will take you along with me on the journey of learning these new skills and further improving my existing skillset. I am currently in the process of getting my HTB CDSA and Splunk certificates!
